# Zuma for Home Assistant

Local control of [Zuma](https://zuma.ai) ceiling speaker-lights (Lumisonic / Zuma SL)
over the local network — no cloud, no account, no API key.

## What it does

| Entity | Backing node | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `light` | `zuma:lightState` | on/off, brightness, colour temperature (2200–6500 K) |
| `media_player` volume / mute | `player:volume`, `settings:/mediaPlayer/mute` | volume 0–100 ↔ HA 0.0–1.0 |
| `media_player` transport | `player:player/control` | pause, stop; next/previous only when the stream reports them |
| `media_player` play URL | DLNA `AVTransport` | `media_player.play_media` — start a stream URL |
| `media_player` now playing | `player:player/data` | state, title, artwork, `zuma_service` attribute |
| `switch` circadian lighting | `settings:/zuma/circadianLighting` | mode toggle |
| `switch` status LED curfew | `settings:/zuma/ledCurfewEnabled` | quiets the indicator LED overnight (config) |
| `sensor` WiFi signal / IP / firmware / thermal mode | `network:info`, device identity, `zuma:volatile/temperatureMode` | read-only diagnostics |
| `binary_sensor` smart bezel / area master | `settings:/zuma/bezelAttached`, `settings:/system/zuma/zumaMaster` | read-only diagnostics |

Units are discovered automatically over mDNS (`_sues800device._tcp`); the TXT record's
serial becomes the unique ID, so discovered and manually-added entries resolve to one
device. Manual setup by IP also works.

State changes are **pushed**: the integration long-polls the device's event queue
(`/api/event/*`, subscribing to leaf nodes as type `item`) and refreshes within ~2 s
of a change made from the app or the unit itself. A 10 s poll runs as a fallback and
catches changes push doesn't signal (notably app/CoAP-driven light changes).

## Install

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=luismalves&repository=zuma-hacs&category=integration)

Click the button above (requires [HACS](https://hacs.xyz)), or add it manually:

HACS → three-dot menu → Custom repositories → this repo, category *Integration*.
Then **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Zuma**.

Or copy `custom_components/zuma/` into your HA `config/custom_components/` and restart.

## Playing a stream URL (internet radio, etc.)

Use the standard `media_player.play_media` action — no custom service:

```yaml
action: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.zuma_bathroom
data:
  media_content_id: https://playerservices.streamtheworld.com/api/livestream-redirect/RADIO_RENASCENCA.mp3
  media_content_type: music
```

Under the hood the nsdk API can't *start* a URL (only pause/stop/skip), so this bridges
to the unit's own Rygel DLNA renderer: a unicast SSDP M-SEARCH finds it each call (its
port is ephemeral and moves across reboots), then `SetAVTransportURI` + `Play`. Volume,
mute, pause and stop still go through the nsdk API. HA media-source items (TTS, the
media browser) work too, not just raw URLs.

**Format limits** (the renderer probes the URL and enforces its sink list): MP3
(`audio/mpeg`) and clean AAC/MP4 play. **HLS (`.m3u8`) and ICY `audio/aacp` do not** —
notably streamtheworld's `.aac` mounts serve `audio/aacp` and are refused, so use the
station's `.mp3` mount.

## How light control works

The lamp is a composite settings value with power, brightness (0–100) and colour
temperature (Kelvin):

```
zuma:lightState = {"type": "zumaLightState", "zumaLightState": {
  "power": true, "brightness": 25, "temperature": 3869,
  "lastTransitionPeriod": "ms1000"}}
```

The canonical node `settings:/zuma/lightState` is flagged `"internal": true` in the
firmware, so enumeration never lists it and `getData` returns *"Node is internal"*. But
the device mirrors the lamp into the **`zuma:` volatile namespace**, and `zuma:lightState`
is served over the LAN for both read and write with no authentication — no DTLS, no
CoAP, no per-device key. Notes that shaped the entity:

- **Colour temperature**: the firmware tolerates 1000–8000 K but the entity clamps to
  2200–6500 K, the range a fixture actually renders.
- **Brightness and power are independent** — `brightness: 0` leaves `power: true` (on
  but dark), so turn-off writes `power: false` and keeps the brightness, restoring the
  level on turn-on.
- **Transition** enum: `instant, ms125, ms250, ms500, ms1000, ms2000, ms4000`; HA's
  transition seconds snap to the nearest bucket.

## What isn't possible locally

- **Starting native (airable) internet radio.** Browsing the airable directory works,
  but nothing in the HTTP API *starts* a station: `player:player/control` accepts only
  `pause`/`stop`/`next`/`previous` (24 other verb spellings were tried), and activating
  a station only navigates. Start playback from the Zuma app / AirPlay / Spotify /
  TIDAL and this integration then controls it — or push any stream URL yourself with
  `play_media` (above), which is the practical substitute.
- **Numeric device temperature.** The unit measures SoC / MCU / LED / amp temperatures
  (`zuma-metric-gatherer` reading `/sys/class/thermal/...`) but **publishes them only as
  MQTT telemetry to Zuma's cloud** — they are never written to a locally-readable node.
  The app's temperature figure comes from the cloud. The only local thermal signal is
  the `thermal_mode` enum (`normal` → `limited` → `shutdown`), exposed as a sensor.

## The device API, for reference

Port 80, plaintext, unauthenticated. It is the StreamUnlimited StreamSDK web API — the
hardware pairs a StreamUnlimited S800 audio module (which owns this API) with Zuma's own
light/MCU board, which is why audio is richly exposed and the lamp hides in the `zuma:`
mirror.

```
GET  /api/getData?path=<path>&roles=<comma,separated>
GET  /api/getRows?path=<path>&roles=<r>&from=<i>&to=<i>
POST /api/setData   {"path":..,"role":..,"value":..}
GET  /api/event/modifyQueue?queueId=&subscribe=[..]&unsubscribe=[..]
GET  /api/event/pollQueue?queueId=&timeout=<ms>
```

Two things will trip you up:

1. **Values are tagged unions.** A read returns `[{"i32_": 22, "type": "i32_"}]`, and a
   write must re-tag with the matching type name. Booleans tag as `bool_`, not `i32_`,
   even though Python's `bool` is an `int`.
2. **Application errors come back as HTTP 500 with a JSON body**, not a transport error:
   `{"error": {"name": "CMAbstractWorker::invalidPath", "message": "..."}}`.

Useful roles: `value`, `title`, `type`, `path`. Enumerate a container with
`getRows?roles=path,type`.

Open ports on the unit: **80** StreamSDK API, **2019** TIDAL Connect, **7000** AirPlay,
**8080 / 8085** unidentified (bare 404s), **41347** (ephemeral) the Rygel DLNA
MediaRenderer, **5683/udp** plain CoAP (answers `4.04` unauthenticated), **5684/udp** the
Zuma CoAP/DTLS channel (per-device X.509 cert in `settings:/zuma/factoryCert` /
`factoryKey`). Spotify Connect rides on port 80 at `/api/stream/spotify:zeroconf`.

## Tests

Offline tests (value codec, request shapes, DLNA helpers) need no device and no Home
Assistant:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-test.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_api.py tests/test_dlna.py -q
```

Live tests talk to a real unit and print its responses:

```bash
ZUMA_HOST=192.168.20.158 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_live.py -v -s
```

Reads are safe; write round-trips (volume, light) move real hardware and restore it, so
they are gated behind an explicit opt-in:

```bash
ZUMA_HOST=… ZUMA_ALLOW_WRITE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_live.py -v -s
```

A standalone explorer needs neither pytest nor Home Assistant:

```bash
python3 scripts/live_check.py <ip>                       # full report
python3 scripts/live_check.py <ip> --ls settings:/       # list a container
python3 scripts/live_check.py <ip> --walk settings:/zuma # dump a subtree
python3 scripts/live_check.py <ip> --get player:volume
python3 scripts/live_check.py <ip> --set player:volume 25
```
